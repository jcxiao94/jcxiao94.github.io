<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, collaborating with Professor [De-Jun Feng](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~djfeng/).

Before this, I was a PhD student in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University, supervised by Professor [Huo-Jun Ruan](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0002379).

In my spare time, reading is perhaps my favorite interest. I also run and do some sports (basketball, badminton, etc.) occasionally.

### Research interests

- Topological properties of fractal sets
- Dimension theory of fractal sets
- Metric geometry of (fractal) sets
